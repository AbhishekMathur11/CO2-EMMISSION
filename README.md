## Intelligent CO2 Emission Prediction Methods
Welcome to the Intelligent CO2 Emission Prediction project! This initiative combines cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to predict CO2 emissions for cities, incorporating synthetic and real-world data. The model considers features such as population, area, and green spaces, and uniquely, it integrates real-world traffic data from the Google Maps API and weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Overview
This project encompasses the entire data science pipeline, from generating synthetic data to implementing an advanced Gradient Boosting Regressor model for accurate CO2 emission predictions. Real-world traffic and weather data are seamlessly integrated, providing a holistic and precise prediction model.

Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Simulate city characteristics using synthetic data.
Advanced Machine Learning Model: Leverage a Gradient Boosting Regressor for highly accurate CO2 emission predictions.
Real-world Data Integration: Incorporate real-world traffic and weather data, enhancing model accuracy and relevance.
